Tuple unpacking is a shortcut for assigning each item in a list to their own variable. The variable names must equal the number of items in the list or else an error will occur.

```py
character_list = ['Aragorn', 'Legolas', 'Bilbo']
human, elf, hobbit = character_list
print(human, elf)

# Output: Aragorn Legolas
```
