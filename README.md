# Reference Guides README

This is a repository for code snippets and explanations. Instead of searching back through old ebooks, bookmarks, and internet articles, I decided to keep a repo of things that I've learned while studying programming. 

Note: These guides are non-comprehensive. I will update them as I encounter new things, but they are not intended to be an all-encompassing guide. I've linked to as many helpful resources as I can. Please reach out if you have suggestions, comments, or guidance on anything you see here. Overall, I hope you find this information to be useful =D
